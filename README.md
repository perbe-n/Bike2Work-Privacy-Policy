Privacy Policy for Bike2Work
Effective Date: January 30, 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how perbe ("we", "us", or "our") manages data in the Bike2Work mobile application (the "App").
1. Privacy by Design (GDPR & CCPA Compliance)
We believe in absolute privacy. The App is designed so that:
•
No Personal Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or IP addresses.
•
No Account Required: You can use all features of the App without creating an account or logging in.
•
Local Storage Only: All your data (commute logs, bike settings, and CO2 preferences) is stored exclusively on your device's internal storage (via Room Database and SharedPreferences). We have no access to this data.
2. Permissions and Data Usage
The App requests specific permissions to function correctly:
•
Internet Access: Used solely to fetch map tiles from OpenStreetMap. No user data is sent along with these requests.
•
Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS): Used to provide reminders for logging commutes. This is handled locally via Android's WorkManager.
•
Location Data: If you grant location permissions, it is used only to display your current position on the map. This data is never uploaded to any server or shared with third parties.
3. Third-Party Services
We use the following third-party libraries:
•
osmdroid (OpenStreetMap): To display maps. When maps are loaded, your device connects to OpenStreetMap servers. You can view their privacy policy at https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy.
•
Google Play Services: The App is distributed via the Google Play Store. Google may collect anonymous diagnostic information (crash logs, device model) to improve service stability.
4. Data Security and Retention
Since your data is stored locally:
•
Control: You have full control over your data. You can modify or delete your commute history at any time within the App.
•
Deletion: Uninstalling the App will automatically delete all data associated with it from your device.
•
Security: We rely on the Android Operating System's built-in security features to protect the data stored on your device.
5. Children’s Privacy (COPPA)
The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since no data is transmitted to us, we do not store any information from any users, regardless of age.
6. International Users (EU/USA)
This policy is intended to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Because we do not collect personal data, most provisions regarding data portability and "Right to be Forgotten" are managed directly by you through your ability to delete the App or its data.
7. Contact Information
For any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the contact details provided in the Google Play Store listing.
