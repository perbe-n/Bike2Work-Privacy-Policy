Privacy Policy for Bike2Work

Effective Date: January 30, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how perbe (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles data in the Bike2Work mobile application (the “App”).

Privacy by Design (GDPR & CCPA Compliance)

We believe in absolute privacy. The App is designed according to privacy-by-design principles:

No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), including names, email addresses, phone numbers, or IP addresses.

No Account Required
All features of the App are available without creating an account or logging in.

Local Storage Only
All data (commute logs, bike settings, and CO₂ preferences) is stored exclusively on your device using Room Database and SharedPreferences. We do not have access to this data.

Permissions and Data Usage

The App requests the following permissions to function correctly:

Internet Access
Used solely to fetch map tiles from OpenStreetMap. No user data is sent with these requests.

Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS)
Used to provide reminders for logging commutes. Notifications are handled locally using Android’s WorkManager.

Location Data
If you grant location permissions, the data is used only to display your current position on the map. Location data is never uploaded to any server or shared with third parties.

Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services and libraries:

osmdroid / OpenStreetMap
Used to display maps. When maps are loaded, your device connects directly to OpenStreetMap servers.

Google Play Services
The App is distributed via the Google Play Store. Google may collect anonymous diagnostic information (such as crash logs or device model) to improve service stability.

Data Security and Retention

Because all data is stored locally on your device:

User Control
You have full control over your data and can modify or delete your commute history at any time within the App.

Data Deletion
Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all associated data from your device.

Security
Data protection relies on the built-in security features of the Android operating system.

Children’s Privacy (COPPA)

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Since no data is transmitted to us, we do not store personal information from any users, regardless of age.

International Users (EU / USA)

This Privacy Policy is intended to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
Because no personal data is collected, rights such as data portability and the “right to be forgotten” are exercised directly by the user through deleting data or uninstalling the App.
